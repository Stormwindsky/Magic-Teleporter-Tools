# Magic-Teleporter-Tools


# About This Mod

 

These two tools can be used, for example, if you've lost your portal and need to teleport, but BE CAREFUL, you risk suffocating in the blocks at your peril.

 
# How to use them?

 

In overworld, you need to click on a block close to you, but if you're in a dimension, click away from a block close to you.


# Can i use this Mod for a ModPack & Fork?

You don't even have to ask my permission, if you credit me of course :)
